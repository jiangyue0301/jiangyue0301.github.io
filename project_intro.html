       <div class="Introduction">
        This project originates from my internship with a non profit organization in China during taking two semesters off. The local non profit organization I work for intended to set up a department called a communication center which produced news. 
        However, all writers in it were the same staff in other departments who were not professional with media communication at the beginning. 
        Realizing this problem, the founder of the organization hired a former journalist who had worked for Xinhua Net, a state press in China. 
        This reflects a change among non profit organizations. Even if Chinese and American non profit organizations are at different levels of development they are facing the same problem. There is a prominent phenomenon that NGOs begin to play the role of communicator in the U.S.
        This project seeks to research the ways in which environmental nonprofit organizations in Michigan have been able to produce and distribute their own news, and the barriers and obstacles that they face in doing so. The reason that I select ENGO as my topic is that they need science communication. Environmental issues are always with a scientific background.
